x Add a delete link for an item in the journal
x Start CSS for the Journal page
x The tab has to refresh itself each time the Journal changes
x Do not use a list
- When tagging a PDF paper we should extract its title
- When tagging something with a feed we should propose to tag entire feed
x When clicking on the browser icon we should open the Journal tab
x Export the Journal to json
- Devise a better mechanism to update the Journal tabs on each change
  Should be impl using the sendMessage() / onMessage mechanism
x Move to chrome.storage to sync local storage between different browsers
- Importing journal
- Tagging PDF documents misses a title
- Automatically add tags on different contents: e.g. if I tag a PDF then add #pdf
  to the journal item
- Lots of web pages have a div of class='tags': use that to suggest tags for the
  current page
- Move to IndexedDB ASAP! chorme.storage.sync is too small to store even moderately
  sized data. We will lose sync but we simply can't use chrome.storage.*.
